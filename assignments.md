Homework 1: Create a classifier
===============================
Submit an ipython notebook where you:

  1. Find a region of interest (land, water, buildings)
  
  2. Explain why you chose that region (in a comment or markdown text)
  
  3. Compute the pdfs of he RGB values of that region
  
  4. Develop a mask (which is a classification rule) based on those pdfs
  
  5. Explain the criteria choices (why you use certain thresholds, why a certain combination)
  
  6. Apply that mask to the data
  
  7. Visualize the two classes (data in mask, data not in mask)
  
  8. Explain the visual differences between the two classes
  
  9. Compute the pdfs of the classes.
  
  10. Explain how the classes differ based on the pdfs
  
  11.  Explain whether this was a good classifier or not, with a justification based on the graphs and othe explainations. 

The grade will be almost completely dependent on the explanations.

Homework 2: Test the Classifier from Homework 1
===============================================

Submit an ipython notebook where you take the classification criteria you discussed in homework 1 and:

  1. Apply that criteria to a new landsat image: http://glasslab.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/u/hannah/eas213/
  
  2. Discuss how well (or poorly) the criteria classifies data in the new image:
    * use pdfs and visualzations of the masks (application of the classifier) to justify 
  
  3. Explain whether this was a good classifier or not, with a justification based on the graphs and other explanations. 
  
The grade will be almost completely dependent on the explanations

Group Project: Classify all the things
=======================================

For your group projects, you will work in a team to:

1. Develop and test a classifier for 2 surface types (water, land, buildings, etc.)

2. Create a powerpoint that discusses:

  1. The region of interest
  
  2. The classification criteria & how it was developed

  3. the training of the classification criteria (applying it to the image it was developed with)

  4. the testing of the classification criteria (applying it to a new image)

  5. evaluation of the skill of the criteria (w/ justification using graphs)

For extra credit, you may:

1. Classify more surface types

2. Test on images from multiple seasons

You may not use any classifiers developed in a homework assignment for the project. Use of previous homework assignment will result in a failing grade for the whole group.
